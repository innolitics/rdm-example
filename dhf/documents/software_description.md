# Purpose

This document provides an overview of the operationally significant features of the software within {{device.name}}, using a format that is familiar to FDA reviewers.

[[FDA-SW:software-description]]

# Scope

This document applies to {{device.name}} release {{device.version}}.

# Software Specifics

**What programming languages and compiler versions are used? What hardware platforms are used?**

TODO: Fill this in, or refer to another document

**What operating systems are used (if applicable)?**

TODO: Fill this in, or refer to another document

**Does the device use Off-The-Shelf (OTS) software(s)?**

Yes. Please refer to the Software Design Specification for a list of the OTS used in {{device.name}}.

**What is the intended release version? If the intended release version is different from the documentationâ€™s version, explain the differences.**

The intended release version is {{device.version}}. The documentation's version is the same.

# Software Operation

**Who operates the software (user)? The patient, a caregiver, a healthcare professional, or a combination thereof?**

See the "Users" section of the Software Requirements Specification.

**What is the intended patient population?**

TODO: Fill this in, or refer to another document

**Does the software function focus on a specific disease, condition, patient characteristic or demographic?**

TODO: Fill this in, or refer to another document

**Does the software provide information that is directly applicable to a specific disease or condition?**

TODO: Fill this in, or refer to another document

**If the software performs an analysis of data, what is the analysis methodology? What is the evidence base used for this methodology?**

TODO: Refer to the appropriate sections of the SDS

**Does the software impact or replace any otherwise manual or clinician performed actions? What are the workflow steps and assumptions (from beginning to end state)?**

TODO: Fill this in, refer to another document, or indicate it's not applicable

**If the device is AI/ML-enabled, what populations or samples have informed the model(s)? What steps were taken to identify and address potential biases and limitations of the model(s)?**

TODO: Fill this in, refer to another document, or indicate it's not applicable

# Software Inputs and Outputs

**What are the inputs and their format?**

TODO: Refer to the appropriate sections of the SRS or SDS. Example inputs and outputs include data, images (specify modality), measurements (specify units), sensor/attachments, report, questionnaires, etc.

**Who or what provides the inputs?**

TODO: Fill this in, or refer to other documents. Example responses include: user, other medical devices, other non-medical devices or software.

**Is the device designed to be interoperable?**

TODO: Fill this in, or refer to other documents, such as the archiecture design chart and/or the appropriate sections of the SDS. Another way to ask the question is: does the device transmit, exchange, and/or use information through an electronic interface with another medical/nonmedical product, system, or device? If yes, list the other products that the device interfaces with, and what methods, standards, and specifications are used to interact and/or communicate with other medical/nonmedical products, systems, or devices.

**What are the outputs and their format?**

TODO: Refer to where in the submission the performance testing of the outputs, including test setup, acceptance criteria, and results, are located. Examples: testing for accuracy and repeatability of output measurements, parametric analyses, model outputs, device generated segmentation contours, medical image enhancements.

**To whom are the outputs provided?**

TODO: Fill in this section, or refer to other documents. Examples responses include: patients, caregivers, healthcare professionals, technicians, researchers, health records, interoperable systems.

**What is the data or information flow of the software?**

TODO: Refer to the appropriate parts of the archiectural diagrams. Examples: inputs or outputs transmitted locally, via cloud storage, by disk or drive, or wirelessly.

**Does the software interact with any networked devices? Does the software use cloud or network storage?**

TODO: Update this response as appropriate

Yes, the software interacts with networked devices.

Yes, the software uses cloud or network storage.
